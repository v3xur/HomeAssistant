# HomeAssistant
 Scalable design to measure Temperature/Humidity and energy consumption of a device with YAML using Home Assistant OS. Numerical values in the code are dependent on design specs and hardware configuration.
 If the tempperature or humidity falls out of a set threshold, the user will be alerted with a mobile push notification.
Hardware used:
1. ESP8266 microcontroller
2. DHT22 Temperature/Humidity Sensor
3. INA219 Current Sensor
4. Raspberry Pi
5. LED light
6. 9V battery
